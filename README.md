# 🐍 Python Basics to Advanced

Welcome to my Python learning repository!

This repo includes everything I’ve learned in Python — from basic to advanced topics — through practice files, code examples, and short projects. I have 2 years of real-world experience working with Python, including:

- ✅ Flask
- ✅ FastAPI
- ✅ Django
- ✅ Node.js (as a full-stack developer)
- ✅ REST APIs, JWT Authentication, CRUD operations, and database integration (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)

Now I’m organizing all my knowledge in one place with clean, simple code so I can revise it easily and help others who are learning Python.
